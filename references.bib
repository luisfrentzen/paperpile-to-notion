                   has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from
                   either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited
                   extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work,
                   we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that
                   layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model
                   (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively
                   compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states
                   while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall
                   memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to
                   3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba
                   substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based
                   on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When
                   trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently
                   extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory
                   recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context
                   length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x
                   higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query
                   attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and

               learning, which takes place in the parameter space of a
               multilayer perceptron (MLP). We review the history of supervised
               stochastic gradient learning, focusing on its singular structure
               and natural gradient. The parameter space includes singular
               regions in which parameters are not identifiable. One of our
               results is a full exploration of the dynamical behaviors of
               stochastic gradient learning in an elementary singular network.
               The bad news is its pathological nature, in which part of the
               singular region becomes an attractor and another part a repulser
               at the same time, forming a Milnor attractor. A learning
               trajectory is attracted by the attractor region, staying in it
               for a long time, before it escapes the singular region through
               the repulser region. This is typical of plateau phenomena in
               learning. We demonstrate the strange topology of a singular
               region by introducing blow-down coordinates, which are useful for
               analyzing the natural gradient dynamics. We confirm that the
               natural gradient dynamics are free of critical slowdown. The
               second main result is the good news: the interactions of
               elementary singular networks eliminate the attractor part and the
               Milnor-type attractors disappear. This explains why large-scale
               networks do not suffer from serious critical slowdowns due to
               singularities. We finally show that the unit-wise natural
               gradient is effective for learning in spite of its low

                   semantics of the existing conversation topics gradually
                   shift. In recent years, pre-trained language models like BERT
                   greatly improved the state-of-the-art for a large spectrum of
                   content understanding tasks. Therefore, in this paper, we aim
                   to study how these language models can be adapted to better
                   handle continuously evolving web content. In our study, we
                   first analyze the evolution of 2013 - 2019 Twitter data, and
                   unequivocally confirm that a BERT model trained on past
                   tweets would heavily deteriorate when directly applied to
                   data from later years. Then, we investigate two possible
                   sources of the deterioration: the semantic shift of existing
                   tokens and the sub-optimal or failed understanding of new
                   tokens. To this end, we both explore two different vocabulary

                   methods which help in efficient incremental training for

                   primarily focused on model parameters and training data size,
                   overlooking the role of vocabulary size. We investigate how
                   vocabulary size impacts LLM scaling laws by training models
                   ranging from 33M to 3B parameters on up to 500B characters
                   with various vocabulary configurations. We propose three
                   complementary approaches for predicting the compute-optimal
                   vocabulary size: IsoFLOPs analysis, derivative estimation,
                   and parametric fit of the loss function. Our approaches
                   converge on the conclusion that the optimal vocabulary size
                   depends on the compute budget, with larger models requiring
                   larger vocabularies. Most LLMs, however, use insufficient
                   vocabulary sizes. For example, we predict that the optimal
                   vocabulary size of Llama2-70B should have been at least 216K,
                   7 times larger than its vocabulary of 32K. We validate our
                   predictions empirically by training models with 3B parameters
                   across different FLOPs budgets. Adopting our predicted
                   optimal vocabulary size consistently improves downstream
                   performance over commonly used vocabulary sizes. By
                   increasing the vocabulary size from the conventional 32K to
                   43K, we improve performance on ARC-Challenge from 29.1 to
                   32.0 with the same 2.3e21 FLOPs. Our work highlights the

  abstract      = "We present a novel application of evolutionary algorithms to
                   automate the creation of powerful foundation models. While
                   model merging has emerged as a promising approach for LLM
                   development due to its cost-effectiveness, it currently
                   relies on human intuition and domain knowledge, limiting its
                   potential. Here, we propose an evolutionary approach that
                   overcomes this limitation by automatically discovering
                   effective combinations of diverse open-source models,
                   harnessing their collective intelligence without requiring
                   extensive additional training data or compute. Our approach
                   operates in both parameter space and data flow space,
                   allowing for optimization beyond just the weights of the
                   individual models. This approach even facilitates
                   cross-domain merging, generating models like a Japanese LLM
                   with Math reasoning capabilities. Surprisingly, our Japanese
                   Math LLM achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety
                   of established Japanese LLM benchmarks, even surpassing
                   models with significantly more parameters, despite not being
                   explicitly trained for such tasks. Furthermore, a
                   culturally-aware Japanese VLM generated through our approach
                   demonstrates its effectiveness in describing Japanese
                   culture-specific content, outperforming previous Japanese
                   VLMs. This work not only contributes new state-of-the-art
                   models back to the open-source community, but also introduces
                   a new paradigm for automated model composition, paving the

                   learning through realignment of Variational Autoencoder's
                   latent space. Deep generative models suffer from catastrophic
                   forgetting in the same way as other neural structures. Recent
                   generative continual learning works approach this problem and
                   try to learn from new data without forgetting previous
                   knowledge. However, those methods usually focus on artificial
                   scenarios where examples share almost no similarity between
                   subsequent portions of data - an assumption not realistic in
                   the real-life applications of continual learning. In this
                   work, we identify this limitation and posit the goal of
                   generative continual learning as a knowledge accumulation
                   task. We solve it by continuously aligning latent
                   representations of new data that we call bands in additional
                   latent space where examples are encoded independently of
                   their source task. In addition, we introduce a method for
                   controlled forgetting of past data that simplifies this
                   process. On top of the standard continual learning
                   benchmarks, we propose a novel challenging knowledge
                   consolidation scenario and show that the proposed approach
                   outperforms state-of-the-art by up to twofold across all
                   experiments and the additional real-life evaluation. To our

  abstract      = "Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated exceptional
                   generative capabilities across various areas, while they are
                   hindered by slow inference speeds and high computational
                   demands during deployment. The most common way to accelerate
                   DMs involves reducing the number of denoising steps during
                   generation, achieved through faster sampling solvers or
                   knowledge distillation (KD). In contrast to prior approaches,
                   we propose a novel method that transfers the capability of
                   large pretrained DMs to faster architectures. Specifically,
                   we employ KD in a distinct manner to compress DMs by
                   distilling their generative ability into more rapid variants.
                   Furthermore, considering that the source data is either
                   unaccessible or too enormous to store for current generative
                   models, we introduce a new paradigm for their distillation
                   without source data, termed Data-Free Knowledge Distillation
                   for Diffusion Models (DKDM). Generally, our established DKDM
                   framework comprises two main components: 1) a DKDM objective
                   that uses synthetic denoising data produced by pretrained DMs
                   to optimize faster DMs without source data, and 2) a dynamic
                   iterative distillation method that flexibly organizes the
                   synthesis of denoising data, preventing it from slowing down
                   the optimization process as the generation is slow. To our
                   knowledge, this is the first attempt at using KD to distill
                   DMs into any architecture in a data-free manner. Importantly,
                   our DKDM is orthogonal to most existing acceleration methods,
                   such as denoising step reduction, quantization and pruning.
                   Experiments show that our DKDM is capable of deriving 2x
                   faster DMs with performance remaining on par with the
                   baseline. Notably, our DKDM enables pretrained DMs to
                   function as ``datasets'' for training new DMs.",

                   evaluating natural language understanding (NLU) models, and
                   recent studies have found that entailment pretraining
                   benefits weakly supervised fine-tuning. In this work, we
                   design a prompting strategy that formulates a number of
                   different NLU tasks as contextual entailment. This approach
                   improves the zero-shot adaptation of pretrained entailment
                   models. Secondly, we notice that self-training
                   entailment-based models with unlabeled data can significantly
                   improve the adaptation performance on downstream tasks. To
                   achieve more stable improvement, we propose the Simple
                   Pseudo-Label Editing (SimPLE) algorithm for better

                   Experiments on binary and multi-class classification tasks

                   large language models provide a promising step forward toward
                   bypassing recurrent annotation costs in a low-resource
                   setting. Yet, only a handful of past studies have explored
                   ICL in a cross-lingual setting, in which the need for
                   transferring label-knowledge from a high-resource language to
                   a low-resource one is immensely crucial. To bridge the gap,
                   we provide the first in-depth analysis of ICL for
                   cross-lingual text classification. We find that the prevalent
                   mode of selecting random input-label pairs to construct the
                   prompt-context is severely limited in the case of
                   cross-lingual ICL, primarily due to the lack of alignment in
                   the input as well as the output spaces. To mitigate this, we
                   propose a novel prompt construction strategy -- Cross-lingual
                   In-context Source-Target Alignment (X-InSTA). With an
                   injected coherence in the semantics of the input examples and
                   a task-based alignment across the source and target
                   languages, X-InSTA is able to outperform random prompt
                   selection by a large margin across three different tasks
                   using 44 different cross-lingual pairs.",

                   during pre-training on language corpora. Although word
                   embeddings are usually interpreted as feature vectors for
                   individual words, their roles in language model generation
                   remain underexplored. In this work, we theoretically and
                   empirically revisit output word embeddings and find that

                   language model generation styles. We name such steers
                   LM-Steers and find them existing in LMs of all sizes. It
                   requires learning parameters equal to 0.2\% of the original
                   LMs' size for steering each style. On tasks such as language
                   model detoxification and sentiment control, LM-Steers can
                   achieve comparable or superior performance compared with
                   state-of-the-art controlled generation methods while
                   maintaining a better balance with generation quality. The
                   learned LM-Steer serves as a lens in text styles: it reveals
                   that word embeddings are interpretable when associated with
                   language model generations and can highlight text spans that
                   most indicate the style differences. An LM-Steer is
                   transferrable between different language models by an
                   explicit form calculation. One can also continuously steer
                   LMs simply by scaling the LM-Steer or compose multiple

                   performance, NMT models need to be exceedingly large. In this

                   updating their state with each new data point, and have long
                   been the de facto choice for sequence modeling tasks.
                   However, their inherently sequential computation makes them
                   slow to train. Feed-forward and convolutional architectures
                   have recently been shown to achieve superior results on some
                   sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, with the
                   added advantage that they concurrently process all inputs in
                   the sequence, leading to easy parallelization and faster
                   training times. Despite these successes, however, popular
                   feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer fail to
                   generalize in many simple tasks that recurrent models handle
                   with ease, e.g. copying strings or even simple logical
                   inference when the string or formula lengths exceed those
                   observed at training time. We propose the Universal
                   Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive recurrent
                   sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the
                   Transformer model and which addresses these issues. UTs
                   combine the parallelizability and global receptive field of
                   feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer with the
                   recurrent inductive bias of RNNs. We also add a dynamic
                   per-position halting mechanism and find that it improves
                   accuracy on several tasks. In contrast to the standard
                   Transformer, under certain assumptions, UTs can be shown to
                   be Turing-complete. Our experiments show that UTs outperform
                   standard Transformers on a wide range of algorithmic and

                   LAMBADA language modeling task where UTs achieve a new state

                   makes the application of machine learning algorithms to new
                   tasks or datasets prohibitively expensive. One approach
                   circumventing this cost is training models on synthetic data
                   where annotations are provided automatically. Despite their
                   appeal, such models often fail to generalize from synthetic
                   to real images, necessitating domain adaptation algorithms to
                   manipulate these models before they can be successfully
                   applied. Existing approaches focus either on mapping
                   representations from one domain to the other, or on learning
                   to extract features that are invariant to the domain from
                   which they were extracted. However, by focusing only on
                   creating a mapping or shared representation between the two
                   domains, they ignore the individual characteristics of each
                   domain. We suggest that explicitly modeling what is unique to
                   each domain can improve a model's ability to extract
                   domain-invariant features. Inspired by work on private-shared
                   component analysis, we explicitly learn to extract image
                   representations that are partitioned into two subspaces: one
                   component which is private to each domain and one which is
                   shared across domains. Our model is trained not only to
                   perform the task we care about in the source domain, but also
                   to use the partitioned representation to reconstruct the
                   images from both domains. Our novel architecture results in a
                   model that outperforms the state-of-the-art on a range of
                   unsupervised domain adaptation scenarios and additionally

                   available, and then it is used to generate labels on an
                   unlabeled dataset (typically much larger in size). These
                   labels are then utilized to train the smaller ''student''
                   model which will actually be deployed. Naturally, the success
                   of the approach depends on the quality of the teacher's
                   labels, since the student could be confused if trained on
                   inaccurate data. This paper proposes a principled approach
                   for addressing this issue based on a ''debiasing''
                   reweighting of the student's loss function tailored to the
                   distillation training paradigm. Our method is hyper-parameter
                   free, data-agnostic, and simple to implement. We demonstrate
                   significant improvements on popular academic datasets and we
                   accompany our results with a theoretical analysis which
                   rigorously justifies the performance of our method in certain
                   settings.",

                   emergence of novel abilities with scale have necessitated the
                   construction of holistic, diverse and challenging benchmarks
                   such as HELM and BIG-bench. However, at the moment, most of
                   these benchmarks focus only on performance in English and
                   evaluations that include Southeast Asian (SEA) languages are
                   few in number. We therefore propose BHASA, a holistic
                   linguistic and cultural evaluation suite for LLMs in SEA
                   languages. It comprises three components: (1) a NLP benchmark
                   covering eight tasks across Natural Language Understanding
                   (NLU), Generation (NLG) and Reasoning (NLR) tasks, (2)
                   LINDSEA, a linguistic diagnostic toolkit that spans the gamut
                   of linguistic phenomena including syntax, semantics and
                   pragmatics, and (3) a cultural diagnostics dataset that
                   probes for both cultural representation and sensitivity. For
                   this preliminary effort, we implement the NLP benchmark only
                   for Indonesian, Vietnamese, Thai and Tamil, and we only
                   include Indonesian and Tamil for LINDSEA and the cultural
                   diagnostics dataset. As GPT-4 is purportedly one of the
                   best-performing multilingual LLMs at the moment, we use it as
                   a yardstick to gauge the capabilities of LLMs in the context
                   of SEA languages. Our initial experiments on GPT-4 with BHASA
                   find it lacking in various aspects of linguistic
                   capabilities, cultural representation and sensitivity in the
                   targeted SEA languages. BHASA is a work in progress and will

                   billions of tokens, only to restart the process over again
                   once new data becomes available. A much cheaper and more
                   efficient solution would be to enable the continual
                   pre-training of these models, i.e. updating pre-trained
                   models with new data instead of re-training them from
                   scratch. However, the distribution shift induced by novel
                   data typically results in degraded performance on past data.
                   Taking a step towards efficient continual pre-training, in
                   this work, we examine the effect of different warm-up
                   strategies. Our hypothesis is that the learning rate must be
                   re-increased to improve compute efficiency when training on a
                   new dataset. We study the warmup phase of models pre-trained
                   on the Pile (upstream data, 300B tokens) as we continue to
                   pre-train on SlimPajama (downstream data, 297B tokens),

                   cultural intricacies of Traditional Chinese, as spoken in
                   Taiwan, have been largely overlooked. This paper introduces
                   Taiwan LLM, a pioneering Large Language Model that
                   specifically caters to the Traditional Chinese language, with
                   a focus on the variant used in Taiwan. Leveraging a
                   comprehensive pretraining corpus and instruction-finetuning
                   datasets, we have developed a model that not only understands
                   the complexities of Traditional Chinese but also embodies the
                   cultural context of Taiwan. Taiwan LLM represents the first
                   of its kind, a model that is not only linguistically accurate
                   but also culturally resonant with its user base. Our

                   Chinese text, outperforming existing models that are

                   further innovation, ensuring that the linguistic diversity of

               a sentiment classifier and an adversarial language discriminator.
               Both branches take input from a shared feature extractor to learn
               hidden representations that are simultaneously indicative for the
               classification task and invariant across languages. Experiments

                   box, and it is unclear whether LLMs and chatbots can develop
                   humanlike characteristics in language use. Cognitive
                   scientists have devised many experiments that probe, and have
                   made great progress in explaining, how people comprehend and
                   produce language. We subjected ChatGPT and Vicuna to 12 of
                   these experiments ranging from sounds to dialogue,
                   preregistered and with 1000 runs (i.e., iterations) per
                   experiment. ChatGPT and Vicuna replicated the human pattern
                   of language use in 10 and 7 out of the 12 experiments,
                   respectively. The models associated unfamiliar words with
                   different meanings depending on their forms, continued to
                   access recently encountered meanings of ambiguous words,
                   reused recent sentence structures, attributed causality as a
                   function of verb semantics, and accessed different meanings
                   and retrieved different words depending on an interlocutor's
                   identity. In addition, ChatGPT, but not Vicuna, nonliterally
                   interpreted implausible sentences that were likely to have
                   been corrupted by noise, drew reasonable inferences, and
                   overlooked semantic fallacies in a sentence. Finally, unlike
                   humans, neither model preferred using shorter words to convey
                   less informative content, nor did they use context to resolve
                   syntactic ambiguities. We discuss how these convergences and
                   divergences may result from the transformer architecture.
                   Overall, these experiments demonstrate that LLMs such as

                   results of overfitting pre-trained large language models
                   (LLMs) on very small datasets. In the setting of open-ended
                   text generation, it is well-documented that LLMs tend to
                   generate repetitive and dull sequences, a phenomenon that is
                   especially apparent when generating using greedy decoding.
                   This issue persists even with state-of-the-art LLMs
                   containing billions of parameters, trained via next-token
                   prediction on large datasets. We find that by further
                   fine-tuning these models to achieve a near-zero training loss
                   on a small set of samples -- a process we refer to as
                   hyperfitting -- the long-sequence generative capabilities are
                   greatly enhanced. Greedy decoding with these Hyperfitted
                   models even outperform Top-P sampling over long-sequences,
                   both in terms of diversity and human preferences. This
                   phenomenon extends to LLMs of various sizes, different
                   domains, and even autoregressive image generation. We further
                   find this phenomena to be distinctly different from that of
                   Grokking and double descent. Surprisingly, our experiments
                   indicate that hyperfitted models rarely fall into repeating
                   sequences they were trained on, and even explicitly blocking
                   these sequences results in high-quality output. All

                   grokking by analyzing the loss landscapes of neural networks,
                   identifying the mismatch between training and test losses as
                   the cause for grokking. We refer to this as the ``LU

                   weight norm) typically resemble ``L'' and ``U'',

                   dependence, the emergence of representations, etc. Guided by

                   generation, their performance often lags in lower-resource,
                   non-English languages due to biases in the training data. In
                   this work, we explore strategies for adapting the primarily
                   English LLMs (Llama-2 and Llama-3) to Dutch, a language
                   spoken by 30 million people worldwide yet often
                   underrepresented in LLM development. We collect 104GB of
                   Dutch text ($32$B tokens) from various sources to first apply
                   continued pretraining using low-rank adaptation (LoRA),
                   complemented with Dutch posttraining strategies provided by
                   prior work. For Llama-2, we consider using (i) the tokenizer
                   of the original model, and (ii) training a new,
                   Dutch-specific tokenizer combined with embedding
                   reinitialization. We evaluate our adapted models,
                   ChocoLlama-2, both on standard benchmarks and a novel Dutch
                   benchmark, ChocoLlama-Bench. Our results demonstrate that
                   LoRA can effectively scale for language adaptation, and that
                   tokenizer modification with careful weight reinitialization
                   can improve performance. Notably, Llama-3 was released during
                   the course of this project and, upon evaluation, demonstrated
                   superior Dutch capabilities compared to our Dutch-adapted
                   versions of Llama-2. We hence apply the same adaptation
                   technique to Llama-3, using its original tokenizer. While our
                   adaptation methods enhanced Llama-2's Dutch capabilities, we
                   found limited gains when applying the same techniques to
                   Llama-3. This suggests that for ever improving, multilingual
                   foundation models, language adaptation techniques may benefit
                   more from focusing on language-specific posttraining rather
                   than on continued pretraining. We hope this work contributes
                   to the broader understanding of adapting LLMs to
                   lower-resource languages, and to the development of Dutch

                   important for the broad application of large language models

                   multi-lingual ability-related data, which may be not
                   available for low-resource languages. To solve it, we propose
                   a Multi-lingual Ability Extraction and Transfer approach,
                   named as MAET. Our key idea is to decompose and extract
                   language-agnostic ability-related weights from LLMs, and
                   transfer them across different languages by simple addition
                   and subtraction operations without training. Specially, our
                   MAET consists of the extraction and transfer stages. In the
                   extraction stage, we firstly locate key neurons that are
                   highly related to specific abilities, and then employ them to
                   extract the transferable ability-specific weights. In the
                   transfer stage, we further select the ability-related
                   parameter tensors, and design the merging strategy based on
                   the linguistic and ability specific weights, to build the

                   experiments on mathematical and scientific tasks in both
                   high-resource lingual and low-resource lingual scenarios.
                   Experiment results have shown that MAET can effectively and

                   reducing the high computational demand of large language
                   models (LLMs). However, previous KD methods are primarily
                   applied to white-box classification models or training small
                   models to imitate black-box model APIs like ChatGPT. How to
                   effectively distill the knowledge of white-box LLMs into
                   small models is still under-explored, which becomes more
                   important with the prosperity of open-source LLMs. In this
                   work, we propose a KD approach that distills LLMs into
                   smaller language models. We first replace the forward
                   Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) objective in the standard
                   KD approaches with reverse KLD, which is more suitable for KD
                   on generative language models, to prevent the student model
                   from overestimating the low-probability regions of the
                   teacher distribution. Then, we derive an effective
                   optimization approach to learn this objective. The student
                   models are named MiniLLM. Extensive experiments in the

                   Distillation (KD) emerges as a pivotal methodology for
                   transferring advanced capabilities from leading proprietary
                   LLMs, such as GPT-4, to their open-source counterparts like
                   LLaMA and Mistral. Additionally, as open-source LLMs
                   flourish, KD plays a crucial role in both compressing these
                   models, and facilitating their self-improvement by employing
                   themselves as teachers. This paper presents a comprehensive
                   survey of KD's role within the realm of LLM, highlighting its
                   critical function in imparting advanced knowledge to smaller
                   models and its utility in model compression and

                   around three foundational pillars: \textit{algorithm},

                   implications across diverse fields. Crucially, the survey
                   navigates the intricate interplay between data augmentation
                   (DA) and KD, illustrating how DA emerges as a powerful
                   paradigm within the KD framework to bolster LLMs'
                   performance. By leveraging DA to generate context-rich,
                   skill-specific training data, KD transcends traditional
                   boundaries, enabling open-source models to approximate the

                   insights characteristic of their proprietary counterparts.

                   with training and deploying LLMs present substantial
                   obstacles to transparent, accessible academic research. While
                   several large language models, such as LLaMA, have been
                   open-sourced by the community, these predominantly focus on

                   LLaMA with capabilities for understanding and generating
                   Chinese text and its ability to follow instructions. We
                   achieve this by extending LLaMA's existing vocabulary with an

                   models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive
                   to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if
                   the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his
                   collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the
                   knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much
                   easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a
                   different compression technique. We achieve some surprising
                   results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly
                   improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial
                   system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models
                   into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble
                   composed of one or more full models and many specialist
                   models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that
                   the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these
                   specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.",

  abstract      = "Language models significantly benefit from context tokens,
                   such as prompts or scratchpads. They perform better when
                   prompted with informative instructions, and they acquire new
                   reasoning capabilities by generating a scratch-pad before
                   predicting the final answers. However, they do not
                   \textit{internalize} these performance gains, which disappear
                   when the context tokens are gone. Our work proposes to apply
                   context distillation so that a language model can improve
                   itself by internalizing these gains. Concretely, given a
                   synthetic unlabeled input for the target task, we condition
                   the model on ``[instructions] + [task-input]'' to predict
                   ``[scratch-pad] + [final answer]''; then we fine-tune the
                   same model to predict its own ``[final answer]'' conditioned
                   on the ``[task-input]'', without seeing the
                   ``[instructions]'' or using the ``[scratch-pad]''. We show
                   that context distillation is a general method to train
                   language models, and it can effectively internalize 3 types
                   of training signals. First, it can internalize abstract task
                   instructions and explanations, so we can iteratively update
                   the model parameters with new instructions and overwrite old
                   ones. Second, it can internalize step-by-step reasoning for
                   complex tasks (e.g., 8-digit addition), and such a newly
                   acquired capability proves to be useful for other downstream
                   tasks. Finally, it can internalize concrete training
                   examples, and it outperforms directly learning with gradient
                   descent by 9\% on the SPIDER Text-to-SQL dataset;
                   furthermore, combining context distillation operations can
                   internalize more training examples than the context window
                   size allows.",

                   learn. However, there is very little published experimental
                   evidence to support such a claim. Here, we develop a set of
                   synthetic impossible languages of differing complexity, each
                   designed by systematically altering English data with
                   unnatural word orders and grammar rules. These languages lie
                   on an impossibility continuum: at one end are languages that
                   are inherently impossible, such as random and irreversible
                   shuffles of English words, and on the other, languages that
                   may not be intuitively impossible but are often considered so
                   in linguistics, particularly those with rules based on
                   counting word positions. We report on a wide range of

                   models can be quite difficult to train due to memory

                   training very large transformer models and implement a
                   simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that
                   enables training transformer models with billions of
                   parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or
                   library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline
                   model parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the
                   insertion of a few communication operations in native
                   PyTorch. We illustrate this approach by converging
                   transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using
                   512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire
                   application with 76\% scaling efficiency when compared to a
                   strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which
                   is 30\% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language
                   models can further advance the state of the art (SOTA), we
                   train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model
                   similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9 billion parameter model similar to

                   layer normalization in BERT-like models is critical to
                   achieving increased performance as the model size grows.

                   applications in deep learning, are almost universally based
                   on the Transformer architecture and its core attention
                   module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear
                   attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and
                   structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to
                   address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long
                   sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention
                   on important modalities such as language. We identify that a
                   key weakness of such models is their inability to perform
                   content-based reasoning, and make several improvements.
                   First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the
                   input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities,
                   allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget
                   information along the sequence length dimension depending on
                   the current token. Second, even though this change prevents
                   the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware
                   parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these
                   selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network
                   architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).
                   Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\times$ higher throughput than
                   Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its
                   performance improves on real data up to million-length
                   sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba
                   achieves state-of-the-art performance across several
                   modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language
                   modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the
                   same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in

                   paper, we propose a new approach, named as EFL, that can turn
                   small LMs into better few-shot learners. The key idea of this
                   approach is to reformulate potential NLP task into an
                   entailment one, and then fine-tune the model with as little
                   as 8 examples. We further demonstrate our proposed method can
                   be: (i) naturally combined with an unsupervised contrastive
                   learning-based data augmentation method; (ii) easily extended
                   to multilingual few-shot learning. A systematic evaluation on
                   18 standard NLP tasks demonstrates that this approach
                   improves the various existing SOTA few-shot learning methods
                   by 12\%, and yields competitive few-shot performance with 500
                   times larger models, such as GPT-3.",

                   creates new information security challenges for developers,
                   organizations, and end-users alike. LLMs are trained on large
                   volumes of data, and their susceptibility to reveal the exact
                   contents of the source training datasets poses security and
                   safety risks. Although current alignment procedures restrict
                   common risky behaviors, they do not completely prevent LLMs
                   from leaking data. Prior work demonstrated that LLMs may be
                   tricked into divulging training data by using
                   out-of-distribution queries or adversarial techniques. In
                   this paper, we demonstrate a simple, query-based
                   decompositional method to extract news articles from two
                   frontier LLMs. We use instruction decomposition techniques to
                   incrementally extract fragments of training data. Out of 3723
                   New York Times articles, we extract at least one verbatim
                   sentence from 73 articles, and over 20\% of verbatim
                   sentences from 6 articles. Our analysis demonstrates that
                   this method successfully induces the LLM to generate texts
                   that are reliable reproductions of news articles, meaning
                   that they likely originate from the source training dataset.
                   This method is simple, generalizable, and does not fine-tune
                   or change the production model. If replicable at scale, this
                   training data extraction methodology could expose new LLM
                   security and safety vulnerabilities, including privacy risks
                   and unauthorized data leaks. These implications require
                   careful consideration from model development to its end-use.",

                   substantial computational, memory, and storage costs because
                   it involves processing all of the training examples every

                   (PEFT) (e.g. adapter modules, prompt tuning, sparse update
                   methods, etc.) offers an alternative paradigm where a small
                   set of parameters are trained to enable a model to perform
                   the new task. In this paper, we rigorously compare few-shot

                   smaller task-specific models by either finetuning with human

                   by building large models with extensive data.
                   Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is a crucial
                   technology for deploying these models to downstream tasks
                   with minimal cost while achieving effective performance.
                   Recently, Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM)-based model, has
                   attracted attention as a potential alternative to
                   Transformers. While many large-scale Mamba-based models have
                   been proposed, efficiently adapting pre-trained Mamba-based
                   models to downstream tasks remains unexplored. In this paper,
                   we conduct an exploratory analysis of PEFT methods for Mamba.
                   We investigate the effectiveness of existing PEFT methods for
                   Transformers when applied to Mamba. We also modify these
                   methods to better align with the Mamba architecture.
                   Additionally, we propose new Mamba-specific PEFT methods that
                   leverage the distinctive structure of Mamba. Our experiments
                   indicate that PEFT performs more effectively for Mamba than
                   Transformers. Lastly, we demonstrate how to effectively
                   combine multiple PEFT methods and provide a framework that
                   outperforms previous works. To ensure reproducibility, we

                   inference-time compute is crucial for attaining better
                   performance from large language models (LLMs). In this work,
                   we propose a novel inference-aware fine-tuning paradigm, in
                   which the model is fine-tuned in a manner that directly
                   optimizes the performance of the inference-time strategy. We
                   study this paradigm using the simple yet effective Best-of-N
                   (BoN) inference strategy, in which a verifier selects the
                   best out of a set of LLM-generated responses. We devise the
                   first imitation learning and reinforcement learning~(RL)
                   methods for BoN-aware fine-tuning, overcoming the
                   challenging, non-differentiable argmax operator within BoN.
                   We empirically demonstrate that our BoN-aware models
                   implicitly learn a meta-strategy that interleaves best
                   responses with more diverse responses that might be better
                   suited to a test-time input -- a process reminiscent of the
                   exploration-exploitation trade-off in RL. Our experiments
                   demonstrate the effectiveness of BoN-aware fine-tuning in
                   terms of improved performance and inference-time compute. In

  abstract      = "State-of-the-art distillation methods are mainly based on
                   distilling deep features from intermediate layers, while the
                   significance of logit distillation is greatly overlooked. To
                   provide a novel viewpoint to study logit distillation, we
                   reformulate the classical KD loss into two parts, i.e.,
                   target class knowledge distillation (TCKD) and non-target
                   class knowledge distillation (NCKD). We empirically
                   investigate and prove the effects of the two parts: TCKD
                   transfers knowledge concerning the ``difficulty'' of training
                   samples, while NCKD is the prominent reason why logit
                   distillation works. More importantly, we reveal that the
                   classical KD loss is a coupled formulation, which (1)
                   suppresses the effectiveness of NCKD and (2) limits the
                   flexibility to balance these two parts. To address these
                   issues, we present Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD),
                   enabling TCKD and NCKD to play their roles more efficiently
                   and flexibly. Compared with complex feature-based methods,
                   our DKD achieves comparable or even better results and has
                   better training efficiency on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and
                   MS-COCO datasets for image classification and object
                   detection tasks. This paper proves the great potential of
                   logit distillation, and we hope it will be helpful for future

  abstract = "Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims at distilling the knowledge from
              the large teacher model to a light-weight student model. Enhancing
              model efficiency effectively, mainstream methods often rely on the
              assumption that the teacher model is white-box (i.e., visible
              during distillation). However, this assumption does not always
              hold due to commercial, privacy, or safety concerns, which hinders
              these strong methods from being applied. Towards this dilemma, in
              this paper, we consider black-box knowledge distillation, an
              interesting yet challenging problem which aims at distilling
              teacher knowledge when merely the teacher predictions are
              accessible (i.e., the teacher model is invisible). Some early KD
              methods can be directly applied to black-box knowledge
              distillation, but the performance appears to be unsatisfactory. In
              this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach, which
              makes better utilization of teacher predictions with prediction
              augmentation and multi-level prediction alignment. Through this
              framework, the student model learns from more diverse teacher
              predictions. Meanwhile, the prediction alignment is not only
              conducted at the instance level, but also at the batch and class
              level, through which the student model learns instance prediction,
              input correlation, and category correlation simultaneously.
              Extensive experiment results validate that our method enjoys
              consistently higher performance than previous black-box methods,
              and even reaches competitive performance with mainstream white-box
              methods. We promise to release our code and models to ensure

                   substantial computational resources and vast amounts of text
                   data. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to
                   constructing an LLM for a new language by continually
                   pretraining (CPT) from existing pretrained LLMs, instead of
                   using randomly initialized parameters. Based on parallel
                   experiments on 40 model sizes ranging from 40M to 5B
                   parameters, we find that 1) CPT converges faster and saves
                   significant resources in a scalable manner; 2) CPT adheres to
                   an extended scaling law derived from Hoffmann et al. (2022)
                   with a joint data-parameter scaling term; 3) The
                   compute-optimal data-parameter allocation for CPT markedly
                   differs based on our estimated scaling factors; 4) The
                   effectiveness of transfer at scale is influenced by training
                   duration and linguistic properties, while robust to data
                   replaying, a method that effectively mitigates catastrophic
                   forgetting in CPT. We hope our findings provide deeper
                   insights into the transferability of LLMs at scale for the
                   research community.",

                   sports-related data such as player statistics, game footage,
                   and other relevant information. However, datasets related to
                   figure skating in the literature focus primarily on element
                   classification and are currently unavailable or exhibit only
                   limited access, which greatly raise the entry barrier to
                   developing visual sports technology for it. Moreover, when
                   using such data to help athletes improve their skills, we
                   find they are very coarse-grained: they work for learning
                   what an element is, but they are poorly suited to learning
                   whether the element is good or bad. Here we propose air time
                   detection, a novel motion analysis task, the goal of which is
                   to accurately detect the duration of the air time of a jump.
                   We present YourSkatingCoach, a large, novel figure skating
                   dataset which contains 454 videos of jump elements, the
                   detected skater skeletons in each video, along with the gold
                   labels of the start and ending frames of each jump, together
                   as a video benchmark for figure skating. In addition,
                   although this type of task is often viewed as classification,
                   we cast it as a sequential labeling problem and propose a
                   Transformer-based model to calculate the duration.
                   Experimental results show that the proposed model yields a
                   favorable results for a strong baseline. To further verify
                   the generalizability of the fine-grained labels, we apply the
                   same process to other sports as cross-sports tasks but for
                   coarse-grained task action classification. Here we fine-tune
                   the classification to demonstrate that figure skating, as it
                   contains the essential body movements, constitutes a strong
                   foundation for adaptation to other sports.",

                   assigned to at least two human coders. Moreover, to produce
                   meaningful and useful analysis, human coders develop and
                   deepen their data interpretation and coding over multiple
                   iterations, making TA labor-intensive and time-consuming.
                   Recently the emerging field of large language models (LLMs)
                   research has shown that LLMs have the potential replicate
                   human-like behavior in various tasks: in particular, LLMs
                   outperform crowd workers on text-annotation tasks, suggesting
                   an opportunity to leverage LLMs on TA. We propose a human-LLM

                   generate the final codebook for TA. We demonstrate the
                   utility of this framework using survey datasets on the
                   aspects of the music listening experience and the usage of a
                   password manager. Results of the two case studies show that

                   large language models generalize to new tasks in a zero-shot
                   setting, but so far explorations of MTF have focused on
                   English data and models. We apply MTF to the pretrained
                   multilingual BLOOM and mT5 model families to produce
                   finetuned variants called BLOOMZ and mT0. We find finetuning
                   large multilingual language models on English tasks with
                   English prompts allows for task generalization to non-English
                   languages that appear only in the pretraining corpus.
                   Finetuning on multilingual tasks with English prompts further
                   improves performance on English and non-English tasks leading
                   to various state-of-the-art zero-shot results. We also
                   investigate finetuning on multilingual tasks with prompts
                   that have been machine-translated from English to match the

                   machine-translated prompts leads to better performance on
                   human-written prompts in the respective languages.
                   Surprisingly, we find models are capable of zero-shot
                   generalization to tasks in languages they have never

                   language-specific technologies. The answer to this question

                   distillation, a widely-used technique for transferring
                   knowledge from a large teacher model to a small student
                   model, presents a promising approach for model compression. A
                   significant remaining issue lies in the major differences
                   between teacher and student models, namely the substantial
                   capacity gap, mode averaging, and mode collapse, which pose
                   barriers during distillation. To address these issues, we
                   introduce $\textit{Temporally Adaptive Interpolated
                   Distillation (TAID)}$, a novel knowledge distillation
                   approach that dynamically interpolates student and teacher

                   gradually shifting from the student's initial distribution

  abstract      = "Most Transformer language models are primarily pretrained on
                   English text, limiting their use for other languages. As the
                   model sizes grow, the performance gap between English and
                   other languages with fewer compute and data resources
                   increases even further. Consequently, more resource-efficient
                   training methods are needed to bridge the gap for languages
                   with fewer resources available. To address this problem, we
                   introduce a cross-lingual and progressive transfer learning
                   approach, called CLP-Transfer, that transfers models from a
                   source language, for which pretrained models are publicly
                   available, like English, to a new target language. As opposed
                   to prior work, which focused on the cross-lingual transfer
                   between two languages, we extend the transfer to the model
                   size. Given a pretrained model in a source language, we aim
                   for a same-sized model in a target language. Instead of
                   training a model from scratch, we exploit a smaller model
                   that is in the target language but requires much fewer
                   resources. Both small and source models are then used to
                   initialize the token embeddings of the larger model based on
                   the overlapping vocabulary of the source and target language.
                   All remaining weights are reused from the model in the source
                   language. This approach outperforms the sole cross-lingual
                   transfer and can save up to 80\% of the training steps
                   compared to the random initialization.",

                   models (LLMs) can be adapted for new tasks in a learning-free
                   way: it is possible to intervene on LLM representations to
                   elicit desired behaviors for alignment. For instance, adding
                   certain bias vectors to the outputs of certain attention
                   heads is reported to boost the truthfulness of models. In

                   effective alternative to such representation intervention
                   methods. We introduce a framework called Localized
                   Fine-Tuning on LLM Representations (LoFiT), which identifies
                   a subset of attention heads that are most important for
                   learning a specific task, then trains offset vectors to add
                   to the model's hidden representations at those selected
                   heads. LoFiT localizes to a sparse set of heads (3\%-10\%)
                   and learns the offset vectors from limited training data,
                   comparable to the settings used for representation
                   intervention. For truthfulness and reasoning tasks, we find
                   that LoFiT's intervention vectors are more effective for LLM

                   performance than intervening on heads selected for a
                   different task. Finally, across 7 tasks we study, LoFiT
                   achieves comparable performance to other parameter-efficient
                   fine-tuning methods such as LoRA, despite modifying 20x-200x

  abstract      = "Large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
                   performance on multiple language tasks, yet their safety
                   guardrails can be circumvented, leading to harmful
                   generations. In light of this, recent research on safety
                   mechanisms has emerged, revealing that when safety
                   representations or component are suppressed, the safety
                   capability of LLMs are compromised. However, existing
                   research tends to overlook the safety impact of multi-head
                   attention mechanisms, despite their crucial role in various
                   model functionalities. Hence, in this paper, we aim to
                   explore the connection between standard attention mechanisms
                   and safety capability to fill this gap in the safety-related
                   mechanistic interpretability. We propose a novel metric which
                   tailored for multi-head attention, the Safety Head ImPortant
                   Score (Ships), to assess the individual heads' contributions
                   to model safety. Based on this, we generalize Ships to the
                   dataset level and further introduce the Safety Attention Head
                   AttRibution Algorithm (Sahara) to attribute the critical
                   safety attention heads inside the model. Our findings show
                   that the special attention head has a significant impact on
                   safety. Ablating a single safety head allows aligned model
                   (e.g., Llama-2-7b-chat) to respond to 16 times more harmful
                   queries, while only modifying 0.006\% of the parameters, in
                   contrast to the ~ 5\% modification required in previous
                   studies. More importantly, we demonstrate that attention
                   heads primarily function as feature extractors for safety and
                   models fine-tuned from the same base model exhibit
                   overlapping safety heads through comprehensive experiments.

                   novel perspective for unpacking the black box of safety

                   To address these challenges, our work uncovers the mechanism

                   We first confirm the existence of these safety layers by
                   analyzing variations in input vectors within the model's

                   ratio shifts among layers and the relationships between
                   network structures and certain capabilities, we hypothesize
                   the LLM's multilingual workflow ($\texttt{MWork}$): LLMs
                   initially understand the query, converting multilingual
                   inputs into English for task-solving. In the intermediate
                   layers, they employ English for thinking and incorporate
                   multilingual knowledge with self-attention and feed-forward
                   structures, respectively. In the final layers, LLMs generate
                   responses aligned with the original language of the query. To
                   verify $\texttt{MWork}$, we introduce Parallel
                   Language-specific Neuron Detection ($\texttt{PLND}$) to

                   whether large language models (LLMs) develop a universal

                   In this paper, we address this question by analyzing latent
                   representations (latents) during a word translation task in
                   transformer-based LLMs. We strategically extract latents from
                   a source translation prompt and insert them into the forward
                   pass on a target translation prompt. By doing so, we find
                   that the output language is encoded in the latent at an
                   earlier layer than the concept to be translated. Building on
                   this insight, we conduct two key experiments. First, we
                   demonstrate that we can change the concept without changing
                   the language and vice versa through activation patching

                   systems to low-resource languages. However, concrete evidence
                   for the effects of multilinguality on language modeling
                   performance in individual languages remains scarce. Here, we
                   pre-train over 10,000 monolingual and multilingual language
                   models for over 250 languages, including multiple language
                   families that are under-studied in NLP. We assess how
                   language modeling performance in each language varies as a
                   function of (1) monolingual dataset size, (2) added
                   multilingual dataset size, (3) linguistic similarity of the
                   added languages, and (4) model size (up to 45M parameters).
                   We find that in moderation, adding multilingual data improves
                   low-resource language modeling performance, similar to
                   increasing low-resource dataset sizes by up to 33\%.
                   Improvements depend on the syntactic similarity of the added
                   multilingual data, with marginal additional effects of
                   vocabulary overlap. However, high-resource languages
                   consistently perform worse in multilingual pre-training
                   scenarios. As dataset sizes increase, adding multilingual
                   data begins to hurt performance for both low-resource and
                   high-resource languages, likely due to limited model capacity
                   (the ``curse of multilinguality''). These results suggest
                   that massively multilingual pre-training may not be optimal
                   for any languages involved, but that more targeted models can

                   that the PLMs can accomplish this task based on

                   contemporary experience is that the sparse architectures

                   which would similarly improve training performance. We find
                   that a standard pruning technique naturally uncovers
                   subnetworks whose initializations made them capable of
                   training effectively. Based on these results, we articulate
                   the ``lottery ticket hypothesis:'' dense,

                   weight update, and the pruned LLM can be used as is. We
                   conduct a thorough evaluation of our method Wanda on LLaMA
                   and LLaMA-2 across various language benchmarks. Wanda
                   significantly outperforms the established baseline of
                   magnitude pruning and performs competitively against recent
                   method involving intensive weight update. Code is available
                   at https://github.com/locuslab/wanda.",

  journal       = "arXiv [cs.LG]",
  abstract      = "Similar to humans and animals, deep artificial neural
                   networks exhibit critical periods during which a temporary
                   stimulus deficit can impair the development of a skill. The
                   extent of the impairment depends on the onset and length of
                   the deficit window, as in animal models, and on the size of
                   the neural network. Deficits that do not affect low-level
                   statistics, such as vertical flipping of the images, have no
                   lasting effect on performance and can be overcome with
                   further training. To better understand this phenomenon, we
                   use the Fisher Information of the weights to measure the
                   effective connectivity between layers of a network during
                   training. Counterintuitively, information rises rapidly in
                   the early phases of training, and then decreases, preventing
                   redistribution of information resources in a phenomenon we
                   refer to as a loss of ``Information Plasticity''. Our
                   analysis suggests that the first few epochs are critical for
                   the creation of strong connections that are optimal relative
                   to the input data distribution. Once such strong connections
                   are created, they do not appear to change during additional
                   training. These findings suggest that the initial learning
                   transient, under-scrutinized compared to asymptotic behavior,
                   plays a key role in determining the outcome of the training
                   process. Our findings, combined with recent theoretical
                   results in the literature, also suggest that forgetting
                   (decrease of information in the weights) is critical to
                   achieving invariance and disentanglement in representation
                   learning. Finally, critical periods are not restricted to
                   biological systems, but can emerge naturally in learning
                   systems, whether biological or artificial, due to fundamental
                   constrains arising from learning dynamics and information
                   processing.",
